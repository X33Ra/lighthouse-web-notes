##  VIM launches into the command mode by default.
##  To switch to edit mode (also called "insert mode") you need to give VIM a command to tell it to switch modes. There are two ways to do this:
##  
##  Press "i" to begin inserting text at the current cursor position.
##  Press "a" to begin inserting after the current cursor position.
##  Instruction
##  Press "i" in the file to enter insert mode. Add some text to the file.
##  
##  Getting out of editing mode is a bit more intuitive: just hit the ESC key.
##  
##  Instruction
##  Press ESC in the file to make sure you are back to command mode.
##  
##  Got a handle on those three? Here are some other commands in command mode. And remember, these commands are case-sensitive, so take note of those stray capital letters:
##  
##  Y copies a line of text to the buffer.
##  P pastes it to the cursor's current position.
##  dd will delete the whole line of text. This will also effectively "cut" a line of text as well. When you delete a line, it's placed in the buffer.
##  yy copies a whole line of text.
##  Instruction
##  Try out the commands above while navigating lines (using arrow keys) in command mode.
##  
##  Saving a file
##  While editing a file, its always a good idea to save the text. To do that you would need to do the following:
##  
##  Make sure you are in command mode. Use escape key to make sure.
##  type :w
##  That's it.
##  Instruction
##  Save the file while in command mode.
##  
##  Quit vim
##  Once you have finished editing you can quit vim in one of the following two ways:
##  
##  :wq - write (save) and quit file (and vim)
##  :q! - quit and ignore changes made since last file save.
##  That is all you need to get started with vim.
##  
##  Note
##  To learn more about vim - and there is quite a bit to it - vim comes with a walk through tutor, vimtutor, that you can run on your terminal.

##  Note
##  Here is another quick cheatsheet for vim.
##  
##  Although it may look more complex for a code editor when compared with VSCode, the vim senpais swear by the speed gains once you get used to it.
